## About This Project
MaxNews is a practice project we built to understand how websites work and how to fetch data from the internet.

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)
We built this using four main technologies. Imagine building a smart house:

1.  **HTML (The Structure)**:
    - This is like the **bricks and walls** of the house. It creates the layout, headlines, and empty spaces where the news stories will go.

2.  **CSS (The Style)**:
    - This is like the **paint and interior design**. It makes the website look beautiful, colorful, and easy to read.

3.  **JavaScript (The Brains)**:
    - This is the **smart home system**. It handles the logic—like automatically loading news when you open the page without you needing to do anything.

4.  **API (The Source)**:
    - We use the **NewsData.io API**. Think of this as the **newspaper delivery service**. Our JavaScript (the smart system) asks NewsData.io for the latest updates, and they "deliver" the news data to our website so you can read it.

## Project Structure
- **index.html**: The main homepage.
- **Breaking.html**: A dedicated page for breaking news.
- **International.html**: A page for global news updates.
- **Script/**: Contains the code that connects to NewsData.io.
- **CSS/**: Contains the designs and styles.
